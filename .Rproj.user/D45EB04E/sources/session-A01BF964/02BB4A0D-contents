## Why you shouldn't donate to the Puerto Rican Goverment

The politician in Puerto Rico have a history of arresting outside aid to use the resources for their political campaigns. During the aftermath of María the government withheld aid and stored them to rot in warehouses while the people of the archipialago died. What little aid was distributed was first decorated with stickers promoting the re-election campaigns of various politicians.

## What Else can I do?

### Share the News

The more people know the better are the chances that; 1) The orgs highlighted in this document get the financial support they need and 2) Others community organizers see this document and send me their information so I can add them to the list. Don't let the people from Puerto Rico fade into the background while we suffer colonial violence and the consequences of global warming. 

### Contribute

I probably missed many orgs. If you know of a trustworthy verifiable org please let me know. Sadly this list has a high concentration of orgs from the metropolitan area and we wish to reach more rural orgs.
